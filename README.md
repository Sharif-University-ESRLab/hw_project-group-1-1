Project Number 10
Throttle Valve Controller System Design
Group 1

Ali Hashemabadi


In a car, when you apply pressure to the gas pedal, fuel and air rushes in the motor. The more pressure applied, the more fuel used. The amount of fuel and air is determined by how much the throttle valve is opened. Our goal is to design a throttle valve controller and simulate the system and watch the result.
The system is designed using OpenModelica which is a free and open-source software. This software uses the Modelica language which is an object-oriented language.
You can download the latest version of OpenModelica from the link below: (I have used the version 1.20.0 which was the latest version at the time)
